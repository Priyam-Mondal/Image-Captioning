# Image Captioning using LSTM with Flickr8k Dataset
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an image captioning model that can generate descriptive captions for images. The model uses a combination of VGG16 for feature extraction and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for caption generation. The Flickr8k dataset is used for training and testing the model, and the model has been further tested on images outside of the dataset to evaluate its generalization capabilities.
